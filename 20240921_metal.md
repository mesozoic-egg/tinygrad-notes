# Abstraction in Apple's Metal Framework

Running computation in CUDA is actually quite straight forward:
1. Write a CUDA flavored C++ GPU function, with some keywords that specify dimensions (`blockDim`)
2. allocate memory on GPU with cudaMalloc
3. invoke the function
4. copy result back and print it out

An example would be:

```c++
/*
 * nvcc cuda_example.cu -o cuda_example && ./cuda_example
 */


#include <stdio.h>

// Size of array
#define N 1048576

// Kernel
__global__ void add_vectors(double *a, double *b, double *c)
{
    int id = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(id < N) c[id] = a[id] + b[id];
}

// Main program
int main()
{
    // Number of bytes to allocate for N doubles
    size_t bytes = N*sizeof(double);

    // Allocate memory for arrays A, B, and C on host
    double *A = (double*)malloc(bytes);
    double *B = (double*)malloc(bytes);
    double *C = (double*)malloc(bytes);

    // Allocate memory for arrays d_A, d_B, and d_C on device
    double *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc(&d_A, bytes);
    cudaMalloc(&d_B, bytes);
    cudaMalloc(&d_C, bytes);

    // Fill host arrays A and B
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
    {
        A[i] = 1.0;
        B[i] = 2.0;
    }

    // Copy data from host arrays A and B to device arrays d_A and d_B
    cudaMemcpy(d_A, A, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, B, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Set execution configuration parameters
    //      thr_per_blk: number of CUDA threads per grid block
    //      blk_in_grid: number of blocks in grid
    int thr_per_blk = 256;
    int blk_in_grid = ceil( float(N) / thr_per_blk );

    // Launch kernel
    add_vectors<<< blk_in_grid, thr_per_blk >>>(d_A, d_B, d_C);

    // Copy data from device array d_C to host array C
    cudaMemcpy(C, d_C, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verify results
    double tolerance = 1.0e-14;
    for(int i=0; i<N; i++)
    {
        if( fabs(C[i] - 3.0) > tolerance)
        {
            printf("\nError: value of C[%d] = %d instead of 3.0\n\n", i, C[i]);
            exit(1);
        }
    }

    // Free CPU memory
    free(A);
    free(B);
    free(C);

    // Free GPU memory
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);

    printf("\n---------------------------\n");
    printf("__SUCCESS__\n");
    printf("---------------------------\n");
    printf("N                 = %d\n", N);
    printf("Threads Per Block = %d\n", thr_per_blk);
    printf("Blocks In Grid    = %d\n", blk_in_grid);
    printf("---------------------------\n\n");

    return 0;
}
```

There's barely any "abstractions" per se, at least you don't think about them that
way, all the objects/functions map intuitively to how we imagine a physical GPU
device.

That's not the case in Apple's Metal framework though. Let's see what the code
would look like for Metal, written in objective C, for a similar add operation:

```c++
/*
 * clang -framework CoreGraphics -framework Foundation -framework Metal example.m -o example.o && ./example.o
 */

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <Metal/Metal.h>
#import <CoreGraphics/CoreGraphics.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
        id<MTLDevice> device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice();
        id<MTLCommandQueue> commandQueue = [device newCommandQueue];
        NSError* compileError;
        MTLCompileOptions* compileOptions = [MTLCompileOptions new];
        id<MTLLibrary> library = [device newLibraryWithSource:
        @"#include <metal_stdlib>\n"
        "using namespace metal;\n"
        "kernel void add(const device float2 *in [[ buffer(0) ]],\n"
        "                device float  *out [[ buffer(1) ]],\n"
        "                uint id [[ thread_position_in_grid ]]) {\n"
        "out[id] = in[id].x + in[id].y;\n"
        "}\n"
         options: compileOptions error: nil];
        id<MTLFunction> kernelFunction = [library newFunctionWithName:@"add"];
        //----------------------------------------------------------------------
        // pipeline
        NSError *error = NULL;
        [commandQueue commandBuffer];
        id<MTLCommandBuffer> commandBuffer = [commandQueue commandBuffer];
        id<MTLComputeCommandEncoder> encoder = [commandBuffer computeCommandEncoder];
        id<MTLComputePipelineState> pipelineState = [device newComputePipelineStateWithFunction:kernelFunction error:&error];
        [encoder setComputePipelineState:pipelineState];
        //----------------------------------------------------------------------
        // Set Data
        float input[] = {1,2};
        NSInteger dataSize = sizeof(input);
        
        [encoder setBuffer:[device newBufferWithBytes:input length:dataSize options:0]
                    offset:0
                   atIndex:0];
        
        id<MTLBuffer> outputBuffer = [device newBufferWithLength:sizeof(float) options:0];
        [encoder setBuffer:outputBuffer offset:0 atIndex:1];
        //----------------------------------------------------------------------
        // Run Kernel
        MTLSize numThreadgroups = {1,1,1};
        MTLSize numgroups = {1,1,1};
        [encoder dispatchThreadgroups:numThreadgroups threadsPerThreadgroup:numgroups];
        [encoder endEncoding];
        [commandBuffer commit];
        [commandBuffer waitUntilCompleted];
        //----------------------------------------------------------------------
        // Results
        float *output = [outputBuffer contents];
        printf("result = %f\n", output[0]);
}
```

The peculiar objective C syntax may seem distracting, but even without them, 
you can see we are dealing with a lot more nouns, or in other words, object
orientation layers, here are the steps described in English:

Set up:
1. create an *MTLDevice*

Compile:

2. call a method on the device to create an *MTLLibrary* with the GPU code, 
with options being specified by an *MTLCompileOptions* (aka. a dictionary)
3. call a method on the *MTLLibrary* create an *MTLFunction* 

Describe the computation

4. call a method on device to create an *MTLCommandQueue*
5. call a method on the *MTLCommandQueue* to create an *MTLCommandBuffer*
6. call a method on the *MTLCommandBuffer* to create an *MTLComputeCommandEncoder*
7. call a method on the device to create an *MTLComputePipelineState*
8. call a method on *MTLComputeCommandEncoder* to specify the GPU function that
will be executed, by passing in the *MTLComputePipelineState*, which contains a reference
to the kernel function we compiled on step 2

Allocate memory:

9. call a method on the *MTLDevice* to allocate memory on either CPU or GPU or shared
10. call a method on the *MTLComputeCommandEncoder* to acknowledge the memory created in step 9

Run:

11. call a method on *MTLComputeCommandEncoder* to do the computation
12. call a method on *MTLComputeCommandEncoder* to mark an end to the computation
13. call a method on *MTLCommandBuffer* to mark an end to the computation
14. call a method on *MTLCommandBuffer* to wait until the computation completes

Seeing all these symbols caused me to think about the merits of object orientated
design, especially when compared to CUDA's simple API. It appears that every single
simple function call, like `cudaMalloc` that makes intuitive sense, now has to
be wrapped in a dedicated class file with special getters and setters, for exmaple,
`[encoder setComputePipelineState:[device newComputePipelineStateWithFunction:kernelFunction error:&error];]]`

But putting the rant aside, the verbosity does yield a nice conceptual model
that describes the GPU programming in a hardware agnostic manner, so maybe 
it's worth the trade off with regards to simplicity.

## The abstractions 

[Reference article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/performing_calculations_on_a_gpu?language=objc)

We start with the physical GPU chip, Metal calls it MTLDevice. Each device
has its own MTLDevice, like a file handle that represents the underlying hardware.

```
                     
                                        
 ┌──────────┐┌──────────┐┌──────────┐   
 │ Physical ││ Physical ││ Physical │

 └──────────┘└──────────┘└──────────┘   
    ▲           ▲           ▲           
    │           │           │           
 ┌──┴───────┐┌──┴───────┐┌──┴───────┐   
 │MTLDevice ││MTLDevice ││MTLDevice │   
 │instance1 ││instance2 ││instance3 │   
 └──────────┘└──────────┘└──────────┘   
                                        
```

You can think of MTLDevice as `class MTLDevice: def __init__(self, device_number:int)...`
in python, although in Objc-C it is defined as a protocol, and the operating
system provide the "instance" to you directly. One of the commond way to access it
is by calling the top level `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` C function (objective C
can invoke C function the normal way).

Obtaining a handle to the device is required to compile (maybe not?) and run code.
The Metal code, when compiled into byte code, is called an MTLLibrary. Think of it
as just a fancy dictionary:

```python
class MTLLibrary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mapping = {
            "add": b"\x001010101010010101" # the binary here is the compiled C++ we wrote earlier
        }
```

You might think obtaining a reference to the `add` function is just a matter of indexing
into the mapping object, but it seems that object oriented designer prefers
to create a separate class for it, hence MTLFunction:

```python
class MTLFunction:
    def __init__(self, lib: bytes)

class MTLLibrary:
    def newFunctionWithName(self, name):
        return MTLFunction(self.mapping[name])
```


Having the byte code doesn't mean you can call it, so there's another class
for running it, called an MTLComputePipelineState

```python
class MTLComputePipelineState:
    def __init__(self, fn: MTLFunction): pass
    def __call__(self): ...
```

And you call the newComputePipelineStateWithFunction on the library to get an instance of it:

```python
class MTLLibrary:
    def newComputePipelineStateWithFunction(self, function: MTLFunction):
        return MTLComputePipelineState(function)
```

To create this MTLLibrary, call the `newLibraryWithSource` on your device.

Visually:

```
                                                                              
                                                                                                    
                                    newComputePipelineStateWithFunction

```

Now we have finished the compilation step, which corresponds to running
`nvcc file.cu`, let's look at the next step, setting up the computation
on GPU.

You may think that all that takes to prepare the GPU for computation is
just 1. allocate memory 2. specify size, and 3. pass in the C++ executable,
at least that's how I thought, there are more to it though. 

First, there needs to be a way to communicate with the GPU, instead of 
calling some low level C functions from other libraries, Metal wraps them
all under an instance called *MTLCommandQueue*. If you want to tell
GPU to allocate some memory, set up the function to execute, etc., you will
send those instruction to MTLCommandQueue, it might be tempting to think of 
it as:

```python
class MTLCommandQueue:
    def alloc(self, size):
        # call low level C function
```

But having it take in direct command is not ideal, you may have multiple threads
of program all trying to send this alloc command on the same GPU, so there needs
to be a mechanism to devide them, metal calls this `MTLCommandBuffer`, again,
object oriented design seem to really want to give an unintuitive name to
everything intuitive...

So the model would look like, essentially we just send a list of instructions,
so it is clear where each instruction originated and retain the ordering.

```python
class MTLCommandQueue:
    def send_instructions(self, commandBuffer):
        for instruction in commandbBuffer.instructions:
            externallibrary.run(instruction)

class CommandBuffer:
    def alloc(self, size):
        self.instructions.append(f"alloc(size)")
    def commit(self):
        mtlCommandQueue.send_instructions(self)
```

Obviously, appending string to a list is not ideal, and there could
be multiple threads sending instructions, there needs to be
a structured way to handle them, as a result, instead of doing the manual 
appending string, let's create a separate class to handle it, Metal calls 
this MTLComputeCommandEncoder:

```python
class CommandBuffer:
    def send_instructions(self, commandEncoder):
        self.instructions.append(commandEncoder)
    def commit()...

class CommandEncoder:
    def dispatchThreadGroups(): pass
    def setBuffer(): pass
    def setComputePipelineState(): 
    def endEncoding(self):
        commandBuffer.send_instructions(self)
    

```

It seems a bit redundant, but you get the idea. In fact, most
of the useful functions are defined on the encoder level, as you see
on the pseudo python code above. dispatchThreadGroups is analogous to
specifying the grid size etc. when launching a CUDA kernel,
setBuffer is like `cudaMemcpy` and `setComputePipleineState` is like CUDA's `add_vectors<<<` triple
angle bracket telling it which function to run.
